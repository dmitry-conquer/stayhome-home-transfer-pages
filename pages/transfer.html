            <h2><span class="primary-hl">Seamless Transfer </span> of HomeCare Services to Stay at Home Homecare</h2>
            <p>
              It is within the patient’s rights to select any Homecare agency of their choice. If you or your caregiver
              are dissatisfied with the quality of services provided by your current Homecare agency, the patient has
              the right to choose any agency for any reason. <br /><br />
              Please note that transferring homecare services to another agency can be a difficult process if not done
              properly. Inexperienced agencies may mishandle the transfer, leading to gaps in patient services, and
              caregivers may not get paid for several days or even longer. At Stay at Home Homecare, we understand the
              importance of a proper transfer. Our experienced coordinators will ensure that your caregiver does not
              lose any work hours during the transfer and the patient will not miss any of the services provided to
              them. We strive to make the transfer process as seamless and painless as possible for you and your loved
              ones.
