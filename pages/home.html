            <p>
              It is within the patient’s rights to select any Homecare agency of their choice. If you or your caregiver
              are dissatisfied with the quality of services provided by your current Homecare agency, the patient has
              the right to choose any agency for any reason. <br /><br />
              Please note that transferring homecare services to another agency can be a difficult process if not done
              properly. Inexperienced agencies may mishandle the transfer, leading to gaps in patient services, and
              caregivers may not get paid for several days or even longer. At Stay at Home Homecare, we understand the
              importance of a proper transfer. Our experienced coordinators will ensure that your caregiver does not
              lose any work hours during the transfer and the patient will not miss any of the services provided to
              them. We strive to make the transfer process as seamless and painless as possible for you and your loved
              ones.

              Applying for a Homecare program is one of the essential things a senior or someone with a long-term
              condition or disability can do for themselves. However, the application process can be extremely tedious
              and frustrating for someone doing it for the first time. Multiple mandatory steps, assessments, and
              document submissions must be scheduled, kept, and submitted on time. Fortunately, our Intake coordinators
              have many years of experience helping others apply for the Homecare program. They guided and supported
              hundreds of people like you to apply successfully and get approved. Let us help you. We won’t let you

              Choosing a caregiver is a crucial decision that requires careful consideration. Most people are unprepared
              to make this decision, especially if they need an aide from a home care agency they are meeting for the

            <h2>Choosing your MCO</h2>
            <p>
              Community Health Choices is a long-term support program designed to roll all health care, behavioral
              health care, and long-term services into one extensive plan managed and coordinated by Managed Care
              Organizations (MCOs). Managed Care Organizations, also known as (MCO) deliver and pay for participants’
              services instead of the state.
              <br /><br />
              Anyone receiving Home and Community-Based Services (Home Care program) can choose one of the three Managed
              Care Organizations (MCOs). Your Homecare agency will work directly with the MCO selected by the
              participant if they have a contract with that MCO.
              <br /><br />
              Here are the three MCO options:
